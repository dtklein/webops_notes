In order to achieve technical success and best serve the business, you must be able to articulate technical needs in business terms. Below is a glossary of business concepts and then mapping between technical terms and business terms.




Asset: A resource that has value

Liability: A resource, the presence of which is likely to cause a disadvantage 

Expense: The cost required in order to obtain an asset or advantage

Cost: Dollars expended, whether an expense or an investment

Revenue: Dollars coming in

Investment: Expenditure of money or other asset as a means of making more revenue or preventing future costs (Example: a pizza delivery company buying a delivery car)

Capital Expense: Acquisition cost for an asset (lease price for the delivery car)

Operational Expense: Cost to operate an asset (insurance, gas and oil for the delivery car)

Total Cost of Ownership: The sum of the capital expenditure and all operational expenditures associated with the entire life of an asset

Amortization: The division of the capital investment split into parts and spaced-out over the expected lifetime of the asset (Example: a delivery car that cost 20,000$ and which is expected to last for five years is amortized out at 4,000$ per year or 1,000$ per quarter)

Risk: A situation entailing exposure to loss

Exposure: The presentation of a vulnerable asset to causes of threat, without mitigation or compensating controls

Advantage: A condition that makes your product or service favorable

Compensating Controls: Actions or resources that reduce, mitigate or shift risk (also known as security controls)

Oversight: Direction and observation to prevent mistakes or saboutage

Competitive Advantage: The advantage that is a reason why customers should choose your product or service instead of your competitor's product or service (Example: Comparing Linux to Windows, Linux runs in a lower-powered server, has a free cost of acquisition and the source code may be audited by anyone)
